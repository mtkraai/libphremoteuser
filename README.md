libphremoteuser
===============

This extension to [Phabricator](http://phabricator.org/) performs authentication
via a web server's `REMOTE_USER` variable.  It should be able to work with a variety of
major servers such as Apache and Nginx, but I have only tested it with Apache.

It can be used with Basic authentication, but is most useful when the server is
configured for single-sign-on, for example, using kerberos.

Installation
------------

To install this library, simply clone this repository alongside your phabricator installation:

    cd /path/to/install
    git clone https://github.com/make-all/libphremoteuser.git

Then, simply add the path to this library to your phabricator configuration:

    cd /path/to/install/phabricator
    ./bin/config set load-libraries '["libphremoteuser/src/"]'

When you next log into Phabricator as an Administrator, go to **Auth > Add Authentication Provider**.
In the list, you should now see an entry called **Web Server**.  Enabling this provider should add a
new button to your login screen.

In order to actually log in, your web server needs to populate the `$REMOTE_USER` variable when the
login button is pressed.  You can do this by forcing the login URI that Phabricator uses to be
restricted, by adding a directive like the following to your web server configuration (this is Apache2):

    <Location "/auth/login/RemoteUser:self/">
      AuthType Kerberos
      AuthName "Phabricator at My Server"
      KrbAuthRealms DOMAIN.EXAMPLE.COM
      KrbServiceName HTTP
      Krb5Keytab /etc/apache2/kerberos.keytab
      KrbMethodNegotiate On
      KrbMethodK5Passwd On
      KrbLocalUserMapping On
      Require valid-user
    </Location>

    <Location "/auth/login/RemoteUser:self/">
      AuthType GSSAPI
      AuthName "Phabricator at My Server"
      GssapiCredStore keytab:/etc/apache2/kerberos.keytab
      GssapiCredStore ccache:MEMORY:user_ccache
      GssapiAllowedMech krb5
      GssapiUseSessions On
      GssapiNegotiateOnce On
      Session On
      SessionCookieName gssapi_session path=/gssapi-test;httponly;secure;
      Require valid-user
    </Location>


When a user registers using this auth provider, it will attempt to discover
the user's full name and email from LDAP. LDAP parameters are stored in an INI file named ldap_params.ini.
You must edit this file before use.

Security
--------

There are no guarantees about this library being totally secure.  It's not __obviously__ insecure.
However, please make sure to **at least** redirect the login URI to SSL, otherwise your are potentially
sending plain text passwords.

If you care about security consider:
  * Hosting Phabricator entirely on https/SSL
  * Restricting access to the whole Phabricator installation directory, also using SSL.
